    "### Exercise 1: Solution\n",
    "1. Which concepts are modelled in the dataset and how do they relate to each other?\n",
    "\n",
    "   The dataset contains data from `discogs` and models musical artists, their physical releases, and the tracks on those releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The data is stored as tables. Why was this shape chosen and why not the other shapes?\n",
    "   - The number of concepts is limited, fixed, and well-defined.\n",
    "   - The same is true for attributes of these concepts.\n",
    "   - Attributes come from a well-defined domains with a fixed semantic (such as dates, e-mail addresses, ...).\n",
    "   - Instances of concepts are in relation with each other, which may or may not be required to exist.\n",
    "   - In short: we can define a schema, which the rest of the application (the website) relies on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In which normal forms are the corresponding relations?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - All relations are atomic so they are in 1NF.\n",
    "   - `artists` and `releases` both have a singular ID primary key, so they at least 2NF. Upon inspection, there are no transitive dependencies, so they are in 3NF.\n",
    "   - `released_by` does not contain non-key attributes, so it is in 3NF.\n",
    "   - `tracks` has a foreign key constraint but no primary key constraint (although this is not captured by normal forms). The reason is likely because the data is crowd-sourced and archival, and there could be duplicate entries in the database.\n",

    "   - What are some typical queries that would benefit from this change?\n",
    "   - How often do we need to update artists?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   A very typical query is finding all the releases by an artist's name. If we redundantly store the artist's ID and name in `releases`, the aforementioned query now only requires a `SELECT` instead of an expensive `JOIN`. As releases can be released by multiple artists, we could also extend this idea and break 1NF by storing a list of artist names instead. The tradeoff here is that every time we have to update an artist's name we have to find and update all releases by that artist. Considering that reads are very common and changes are rare, the option of denormalizing becomes relatively more attractive.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What potential problems could result from denormalizing the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Insert anomaly: we could insert a release with a fake or incorrect artist name.\n",
    "   - Update anomaly: if we update an artist's name but not all of the records in `releases`, we introduce an inconsistency into the dataset."
